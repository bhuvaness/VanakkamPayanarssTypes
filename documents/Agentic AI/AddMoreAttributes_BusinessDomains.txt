1. Can a Vector DB use the Description field to filter business-specific metadata?

Yes — partially.

If you embed:

Name

Description

maybe Attributes

relationship hints (ParentId)

into a vector, then a prompt like:

“Rental business: tenant onboarding, leases, deposits, occupancy, pricing”

will semantically retrieve tables like:

Building_Leases

Building_Deposits

Building_Occupancy

Building_Pricing

Building_Units

Building_Occupants

This works because vector search captures semantic similarity, not exact keywords.

✅ This is good for discovery and relevance ranking.

❌ This alone is not safe for system-driven schema generation.

2. Why Description-only Vector Search is NOT enough
Problems you will face:

False positives

Building_Revenue may match both Rental and Hotel

Building_Policies is generic

False negatives

A critical table might have a vague description

No hard boundaries

Vector DB cannot guarantee “ONLY rental tables”

Auditing & explainability

You can’t clearly explain why a table was selected

For an ERP / metadata-driven system, this is dangerous.

3. Correct Architecture (Recommended for Your PoC)
Use a Hybrid Semantic + Structured Metadata Model
A. Extend your metadata model (small change, big win)

Add explicit business tags (don’t rely only on Description):

"BusinessDomains": ["Rental", "Hotel"],
"Capabilities": ["Leasing", "Occupancy", "Pricing"],
"LifecycleStage": ["Pre-Sales", "Operations", "Finance"]


Example:

{
  "Name": "Building_Leases",
  "Description": "Lease agreements and terms",
  "BusinessDomains": ["Rental"],
  "Capabilities": ["Leasing", "Contract Management"]
}

B. What goes into the Vector DB

Embed rich text, not raw JSON:

Table: Building_Leases
Purpose: Lease agreements and rental terms
Business Domain: Rental
Capabilities: Leasing, Contract Management
Relationships: Building → Units → Occupants


This gives the embedding model context.

C. Retrieval Flow (Agentic AI)

User prompt:

“We run a rental business. We manage tenants, leases, deposits, renewals.”

Agent does:

Vector search → semantic relevance

Metadata filtering → BusinessDomains = Rental

Graph expansion → Parent/child dependencies

Result:

Deterministic + explainable metadata bundle

4. Where Agentic AI fits (your idea is strong)

Your idea of “users first create Agentic AI” is exactly right.

Agent responsibilities:

Interpret business prompt

Classify intent → Rental / Hotel / Mixed

Query vector DB

Apply rule filters

Validate completeness (no orphan tables)

Produce downloadable metadata package

This is not just RAG — this is Schema-as-Code with reasoning.

5. What NOT to do

❌ Pure keyword matching
❌ Pure vector similarity
❌ Letting LLM decide schema blindly
❌ Runtime schema generation without metadata rules

You were right earlier: “No runtime metadata creation” — that’s correct.

6. Verdict for Your Question

“If I use the Description field… is it possible using vector DB?”

Correct answer:

Yes, vector DB can help discover and rank relevant metadata using descriptions — but for a production-grade ERP PoC, it must be combined with explicit business domain tags, rules, and graph relationships. Vector DB should assist selection, not own authority.

7. Strategic Insight (Important)

What you’re building is not a ChatGPT clone.

You are building:

A Domain-Aware, Metadata-Driven ERP Compiler powered by Agentic AI

That’s far more valuable — and far harder.
